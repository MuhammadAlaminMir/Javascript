//Why does Javascript act like Asynchronous
// Because Javascript is A Single Threaded Language Its means..
//Javascript Process One task at a time

//thats why the Asynchronous trams come so that we can handle multiply work ar a time
//and the process happened as like that no ones depend in other functionality

//Javascript Behind the scene use Two type of data structure to handle Variable and Function

//Our all declared variable/object stored in a data structure thats called Heap
//Our all declared function manage by a data structure thats called Stack
//and the call stack means that a procedure to one by one calling function

//Javascript engine have a proper system to handle the asynchronous process
//the system has
//1. call Stack
//2. Web api
//3.Event Loop
//4.Callback Queue
