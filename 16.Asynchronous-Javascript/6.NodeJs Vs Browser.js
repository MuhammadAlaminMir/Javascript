//Node Js VS Browser
//Does Javascript |Asynchronous  Programming Act Same (v8 Engine)

//V8 is Google's Open source high-performance javascript and WebAssembly Engine, Written in C++
//Thats means V8 is a C++ Program, which receives JavaScript code, compiles, and executes it

//What does V8 engine do ?

//1.Compile and Executes Javascript Code
//2. Handling Call Stack
//3. Handling Heep Memory to Allocate Memory for Variables
//4.Collect Garbage - Release Memory which is No Longer Necessary
//5.Provide Data ATypes, Operator, Objects and Function

//What Does V8 Do not Do ?
//1.Document Object Model (DOM) -v8 Don't know anything about it
//2.Multiple V8 Engine Never Share Variables or Context

//The Answer is Yes
//Because Both behind the scene use the same engine(v8)
//Thats Mean, We don't have to Worry About Platform Anymore

//Javascript has 2 Platform
//1. NodeJs
//2.Browser/Web Platform
