//class in oop

//class is just a factory function to create multiple object without code duplication

//think that a class is a frame to make a cake every time when we need to make cake we 
//just give the Ingredients and then its done

//like that in real world when we jump to any project sometime in one project we have to white the some
//code in multiply section and its very difficult so that we can use oop class

//in oop class we just make one code for one type component 
//then when we need it we just call it and give it to data it will process everything and
//give us the result ... its like broker --ha ha
