//Inheritance

// Inheritance is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for 
//a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods 





//Inheritance means containing the characteristics of other (object)

//example
//when we make a cake that time we just took a cake frame and give them the ingredients
//other time when we make other type of cake that time we also need a frame and give it the ingredients
//both time we need a frame so why we use two multiply frame . one frame is enough 
//we just need to give two different type ingredients 

//like that when we do same work we can use oop inheritance and give it different data for data for 
//different work and make codes easier
