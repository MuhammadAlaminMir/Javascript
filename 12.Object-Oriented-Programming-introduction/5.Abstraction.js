//Abstraction is one of the  key concepts of oop language. its main goal is to handle 
//complexity by hiding unnecessary details form the user. that enables the user to implement 
//more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about
//all the hidden complexity.. 

//think that we have a food making company when we make the food on one see without us 
//then when the work is finish we sell it outside to the costumer. the costumer don't see that how we work
//how the food was made ..  the costumer didn't know process but he still but it

//this is the abstraction .. we provide data/food or anything but the process is hidden
