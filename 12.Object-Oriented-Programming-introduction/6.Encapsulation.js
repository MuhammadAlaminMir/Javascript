//encapsulation

// encapsulation is  one of the fundamental concepts in oop. it describes the idea of bundling data 
// and methods that work on that data within one unit


// In my opinion 

//encapsulation means a dram where we can store data/properties and method/function and 
//use it like one unit / one team
