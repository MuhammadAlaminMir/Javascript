/// var Vs Let vs Const

//if we declare a variable let then we can change the value of that variable
//if we declare a variable const then we can't change the value fo that variable
//example
//const
const a = 10;
// a = 100
console.log(a);
//let
let b = 10;
b = 100;
console.log(b);

//when we declare a variable with let its can't accessible from outside from his block
//Because let make a block
//now we can make ifi or new block with the carly bracket({})
