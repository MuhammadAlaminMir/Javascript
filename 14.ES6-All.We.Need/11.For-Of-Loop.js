//For Of Loop
//for of loop is a advanced version o iterator
//this time we didn't need to remember the index number

//for of loop can iterate any kind of iterable object
//but it sample can't use for iterate object

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let str = "alamin";

//to declare for of loop at fast we have to declare for the give let and value()v then of then
//the iterate obj into a parentheses then give a body and the result like:

for (let v of arr) {
    console.log(v);
}

for (let v of str) {
    console.log(v);
}
