 //scope means area 
 //in javascript all data stored in scope 
 //basically scope means that into a carly brackets{} 
 //in js we have global scope functional scope etc
 //we can declare a variable in any scope like : global scope or functional scope 
 //global scope variable can be use from anywhere but 
 //functional scope variable can be use only into the function scope

//like:

var abc = 'string'

function newAbc(){
    var abc = 'function String'
}
