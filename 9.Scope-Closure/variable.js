// variable execution 
//when a compiler execute a variable at fast
//creation phase came and locate every variable name and set his value undefined

//then the executional phase came and start executing every thing like:
// var name = alamin
//console.log(name)

//in here creation phase has come and locate a variable name and set its value undefined
//then he see the console.log and he avoid that because its not his work

//then the executional phase come and locate a variable name took the given value into the variable
//in that case execution got (name) value alamin then he set value in name var
//then he go forward or button then he see the console.log(name) in that time he has the rea value 
//and he print in console the value 
//if the console.log define fast and var define last the execute return creation phase value undefined because
//he neither got the real value of the name
