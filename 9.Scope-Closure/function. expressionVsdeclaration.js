//In hare we have two type of function no.1 is a function declaration and no 2. is a function expression
//1. in that function we direct declare a function 
//2. fast we had declare a variable and set its value a function 
//We have remember that 1. is  a real/true function thats in hoisting its treat like a function 
//but no 2. technically a function but truly its a variable in hoisting its treat like a variable 
//that means if we called/console.log no 2. again declare it then the compiler gives us error
