// String Comparison

var a = 'abc'
 var b = 'bcd'

 console.log(a === b)

 //in javascript when we compare string we should remember that 
 //in string small letter is bigger then Capital letter 
 //in small letter z is the bigger latter and a is the smallest letter
 //in capital letter are also same

 //when we compare a string to a number then javascript engine 
 //convert the string and
 //generate a number(we don't know) and then compare with number
