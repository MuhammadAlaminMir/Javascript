//variable is Storage, which Value can be change in future.
//Variable is a container for storing data values. In JavaScript, there are three ways to declare variables: var, let, and const.

//1. var: var is a keyword that is used to declare a variable. It can be re-declared and updated.
//   - Example:
var myName = "Alamin Mir";

// let: let is a keyword that is used to declare a variable. It can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.
//   - Example:
let age = 25;

// const: const is a keyword that is used to declare a variable. It cannot be updated or re-declared in the same scope.
//   - Example:
const birthYear = 1998;
// const birthYear = 1999; // if you declare it again, then This will throw an error because birthYear is a constant and cannot be re-declared

var heKnowProgramming = true;

//if you want to see value in console then type: console.log();

console.log(myName, age, heKnowProgramming);
