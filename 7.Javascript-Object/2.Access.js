// js object accessing

// access can be two type 1. dot notation 2. array notation

//most of the time we use dot notation

var point = {
    x: 10,
    y: 20, 
    z: 30
}

console.log(point.x) //use dot for dot notation
console.log(point.y)
console.log(point.x + point.y)

//Array notation / use array system

//when we don't know which of element we have to work that time we work with array notation 

console.log(point['x'])
